# Instruction Introspection with Pinocchio

Pinocchio uses different types than the `solana_program` crate. This means we had to create a new SDK optimized for Pinocchio.

With the help of [Orion](https://x.com/BasedOrion_), we created a set of helpers that respected the "original"
implementation but made the `Instruction` sysvar — one of the most expensive sysvars to use — one of the most efficient.

For this reason, we can use *Instruction Introspection* in Pinocchio without installing any external crates and can access all the information we need by importing these functions:

```rust
use pinocchio::sysvars::instructions::Instructions;
```

<ArticleSection name="How to use Introspection" id="how-to-use-introspection" level="h2" />

As mentioned previously, Instruction Introspection simply deserializes the data from the `Instruction` sysvar account to provide all the data we need about our instructions.

We start by checking the current index. We can do this by using the `load_current_index_checked` function, like so:

```rust
let instruction_sysvar = unsafe { Instructions::new_unchecked(&self.accounts.sysvar_instructions.try_borrow_data()?) };
let index = instruction_sysvar.load_current_index();
```

After this, we can check an instruction at a relative index using `load_instruction_at_checked`. This time, we'll check the instruction immediately following the one performing the introspection, like so:

```rust
// We load the next instruction, which is the one we want to check for the correct input.
let instruction = instruction_sysvar.load_instruction_at(index as usize + 1)?;
```

Before going to the next step, we should ask ourselves what information is essential to prevent a malicious attack.

We usually start by checking if the program being used is the one we expect. In this example, we're introspecting another instruction from the system program, so we can do it like so:

```rust
if instruction.get_program_id() != &pinocchio_system::ID {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData);
}
```

Next, we check if the instruction is the one we expect. To do so, we compare the discriminator and the instruction data with the expected values. We start by creating an `instruction_data` variable and checking against it, like so:

```rust
let mut instruction_data = [0u8; 12];
instruction_data[0..4].copy_from_slice(&2u32.to_le_bytes());
instruction_data[4..12].copy_from_slice(&100_000_000u64.to_le_bytes());

if instruction.get_instruction_data() != instruction_data {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData);
}
```

We can then perform more program-specific checks based on the logic of the instruction we are checking.

We can also check the accounts present in the introspected instruction. This step requires us to know the exact structure of the account struct, since we'll be requesting the data or pubkey of an account at a specific index, like this:

```rust
if !pubkey_eq(instruction.get_account_meta_at(0)?.key(), self.accounts.from.key()) {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData);
}
```
