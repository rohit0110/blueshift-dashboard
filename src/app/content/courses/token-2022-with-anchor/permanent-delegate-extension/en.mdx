# The Permanent Delegate Extension

The `PermanentDelegate` extension is a Mint account extension that allows a permanent delegate for all tokens of the mint that is capable of transferring or burning any token of that mint, from any token account.

To initialize the `PermanentDelegate` extension on a `Mint` account we can simply use the macro that `Anchor` created for us.

Here's how to create a mint with the Permanent Delegate extension:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateMint<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = signer,
        mint::decimals = 6,
        mint::authority = signer.key(),
        mint::token_program = token_program
        extensions::permanent_delegate::delegate = signer,
    )]
    pub mint: InterfaceAccount<'info, Mint>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
    pub token_program: Interface<'info, TokenInterface>,
}
```

Unlike regular delegates which can be revoked, this delegate authority is permanent and immutable. 

This means that every normal action like `transfer()`, `burn()`, `approve()` and `freeze()` can be executed whenever needed directly by the authority without needing the signature of the actual owner.

This means that we can just use the normal `transferChecked()`, `burnChecked()`, ... instructions and pass in the `PermanentDelegate` authority in the `authority` field.
