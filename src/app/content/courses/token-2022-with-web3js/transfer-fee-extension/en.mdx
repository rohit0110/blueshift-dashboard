# The Transfer Fee Extension

The `TransferFee` extension is a `Mint` extension that lets the creator set a "tax" on the token that is collected every time somebody performs a swap.

To make sure that the fee recipient doesn't get write-locked every time somebody performs a swap, and to ensure that we can parallelize transactions containing a `Mint` with this extension, the fee is set aside in the recipient's Token Account that only the `Withdraw Authority` can withdraw.

<ArticleSection name="Initializing the Mint Account" id="initializing-the-mint-account" level="h2" />

To initialize the `TransferFee` extension on a `Mint` account we're going to need the `createInitializeTransferFeeConfigInstruction()` function. 

Here's how to create a mint with the Transfer Fee extension:

```ts
import {
    Keypair,
    SystemProgram,
    Transaction,
    sendAndConfirmTransaction,
} from '@solana/web3.js';
import {
    createInitializeMintInstruction,
    createInitializeTransferFeeConfigInstruction,
    getMintLen,
    ExtensionType,
    TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
} from '@solana/spl-token';

const mint = Keypair.generate();

// Calculate the size needed for a Mint account with Transfer Fee extension
const mintLen = getMintLen([ExtensionType.TransferFeeConfig]);

// Calculate minimum lamports required for rent exemption
const lamports = await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(mintLen);

// Create the account with the correct size and owner
const createAccountInstruction = SystemProgram.createAccount({
    fromPubkey: keypair.publicKey,
    newAccountPubkey: mint.publicKey,
    space: mintLen,
    lamports,
    programId: TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
});

// Initialize the Transfer Fee extension
const initializeTransferFeeConfig = createInitializeTransferFeeConfigInstruction(
    mint.publicKey,
    keypair.publicKey,
    keypair.publicKey,
    500,
    BigInt(1e6),
    TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
);

// Initialize the mint itself
const initializeMintInstruction = createInitializeMintInstruction(
    mint.publicKey,
    6,
    keypair.publicKey,
    null,
    TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
);

// Combine all instructions in the correct order
const transaction = new Transaction().add(
    createAccountInstruction,
    initializeTransferFeeConfig,
    initializeMintInstruction,
);

const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [keypair, mint]);

console.log(`Mint created! Check out your TX here: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${signature}?cluster=devnet`);
```

<ArticleSection name="Transferring Tokens with the Fee" id="transferring-tokens-with-the-fee" level="h2" />

To transfer tokens for `Mint` that have a TransferFee` extension we have two routes:
- We can use the normal `transferChecked()` instruction and by doing this the calculation of the fee is handled automatically
- We can use the `transferCheckedWithFee()` instruction and supply manually the `fee` we're going to pay in that transfer. This is very useful if we want to make sure to not get "rugged" if the authority change the fee and create a abnormally high fee; it's like setting the slippage for a transfer.

> Even if the authority change the fee, the new fee become active 2 epoch after being set

Here's how to create a transfer using the `transferCheckedWithFee()` instruction:

```ts
createTransferCheckedWithFeeInstruction(
    sourceTokenAccount,
    mint.publicKey, 
    destinationTokenAccount, 
    keypair.publicKey, 
    BigInt(100e6), // transfer amount
    6, // decimals
    BigInt(1e6), // fee paid for the transfer
    undefined,
    TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
)

const transaction = new Transaction().add(transferInstructions);

const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [keypair]);

console.log(`Tokens transferred! Check out your TX here: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${signature}?cluster=devnet`);
```

<ArticleSection name="Harvesting the Fee" id="harvesting-the-fee" level="h2" />

As pointed in the introduction, the transfer fee stays in the `Token` account that is receiving tokens to avoit write-locking the `Mint` account or the `sourceTokenAccount` for this reason, before being able to withdraw the fee we'll need to be able to search for all the `Token` account that have fees to claim.

We can do this by setting a filter and getting all the accounts that belong to that mint like so:

```ts
// Retrieve all Token Accounts for the Mint Account
const allAccounts = await connection.getProgramAccounts(TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID, {
    commitment: "confirmed",
    filters: [
        {
            memcmp: {
                offset: 0,
                bytes: mint.publicKey.toString(), // Mint Account address
            },
        },
    ],
});
```

And get a list of all the `Token` account that have a fee inside of them by unpacking the `Token` account and using the `getTransferAmoun()` function like so:

```ts
// List of Token Accounts to withdraw fees from
const accountsToWithdrawFrom: PublicKey[] = [];

for (const accountInfo of allAccounts) {
    const account = unpackAccount(
        accountInfo.pubkey,
        accountInfo.account,
        TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
    );

    // Extract transfer fee data from each account
    const transferFeeAmount = getTransferFeeAmount(account);

    // Check if fees are available to be withdrawn
    if (transferFeeAmount !== null && transferFeeAmount.withheldAmount > 0) {
        accountsToWithdrawFrom.push(accountInfo.pubkey);
    }
}
```

After that we can use the `withdrawWithheldTokensFromAccounts` instruction with the `Withdraw Authority` to pass in the list of `accountsToWithdrawFrom` like so:

```ts
const harvestInstructions = createWithdrawWithheldTokensFromAccountsInstruction(
    mint.publicKey,
    sourceTokenAccount,
    keypair.publicKey,
    [],
    accountsToWithdrawFrom,
    TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
);

const transaction = new Transaction().add(harvestInstructions);

const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [keypair]);

console.log(`Withheld tokens harvested! Check out your TX here: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${signature}?cluster=devnet`);
```

<ArticleSection name="Updating the Fee" id="updating-the-fee" level="h2" />

After having intialized our `Mint` with the `TranferFee` extension, we might need to update that specific fee in the future. And to make sure that the creator doesn't "rug" their token holder with a "bait and switch" by setting the fee very high everytime a transfer is executed the new `TranferFee` will be activated after 2 epoch.

To accomodate for this, this is how the data of the `TransferFee` extension looks like: 

```rust
pub struct TransferFeeConfig {
    pub transfer_fee_config_authority: Pubkey,
    pub withdraw_withheld_authority: Pubkey,
    pub withheld_amount: u64,
    pub older_transfer_fee: TransferFee,
    pub newer_transfer_fee: TransferFee,
}
 
pub struct TransferFee {
    pub epoch: u64,
    pub maximum_fee: u64,
    pub transfer_fee_basis_point: u16,
}
```

So to change the fee we can use the `setTransferFee` instruction like so:

```ts
const setTransferFeeInstruction = createSetTransferFeeInstruction(
    mint.publicKey
    keypaird.publicKey
    [],
    BigInt(1000), // new transfer fee
    BigInt(100e6), // new maximum fee amount
    TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
)

const transaction = new Transaction().add(setTransferFeeInstruction);

const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [keypair]);

console.log(`Withheld tokens harvested! Check out your TX here: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${signature}?cluster=devnet`);
```
