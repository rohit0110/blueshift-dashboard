# Transfer Instruction

Moves tokens from one account to another. This is the basic operation for sending tokens between users.

Before we can transfer any token, we'll need to already have:
- Initialized a `Mint` account.
- A source `Token` account or `Associated Token` account that already has at least the amount we want to transfer.
- A destination `Token` account or `Associated Token` account that will receive the tokens from the source `Token` account.

> The amount of tokens we transfer are "normalized" for decimals. This means that if we want to transfer 1 token that has 6 decimals, we'll need to actually put `1e6` as amount

<ArticleSection name="Raw Instruction" id="raw-instruction" level="h2" />

By using just "raw" instruction without any abstraction, this is how transferring a token would look like:

```ts
const destination = Keypair.generate();

const destinationTokenAccount = await getAssociatedTokenAddress(
    mint.publicKey,
    destination.publicKey,
);

// Create ATA creation instruction
const createAtaInstruction = createAssociatedTokenAccountIdempotentInstruction(
    keypair.publicKey, // payer
    destinationTokenAccount, // associated token account address
    destination.publicKey, // owner
    mint.publicKey, // mint
);

// Transfer tokens to ATA 
const transferInstruction = createTransferInstruction(
    sourceTokenAccount, // source token account pubkey
    destinationTokenAccount, // destination token account pubkey
    keypair.publicKey, // owner of the source token account
    1e6, // amount
);

const transaction = new Transaction().add(
    createAtaInstruction,
    transferInstruction,
);

const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [keypair]);

console.log(`Token accounts created and tokens transferred! Check out your TX here: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${signature}?cluster=devnet`);
```

<ArticleSection name="Abstracted Instruction" id="abstracted-instruction" level="h2" />

This is how the same instructions would look like abstracted away with the `transfer()` instruction:

```ts
const destination = Keypair.generate();

const destinationAta = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
    connection,
    keypair,
    mint,
    destination.publicKey
);

console.log(`This is your ATA: ${destinationAta.address}!`)
  
let tx = await transfer(
    connection, // connection
    keypair, // payer
    sourceAta, // source token account
    destinationAta, // destination token account
    keypair.publicKey, // owner of the source token account
    1e6, // amount to transfer
);

console.log(`Succesfully Transferred!. Transaction Here: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${tx}?cluster=devnet`)
```
