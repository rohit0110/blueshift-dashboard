<ArticleSection name="Overview" id="overview" level="h2" />

Building mobile apps that interact with Solana goes far beyond connecting wallets. Your users want to transfer tokens, mint NFTs, execute swaps, and interact with programs, all from their phones. This course teaches you how to build these features with mobile-first considerations.

<ArticleSection name="What You'll Learn" id="what-youll-learn" level="h2" />

### RPC Fundamentals

Understanding how your mobile app communicates with Solana is foundational. You'll learn:

- How mobile RPC differs from web RPC
- Setting up reliable connections on unreliable networks
- Caching strategies to minimize requests and save battery
- Choosing the right RPC providers for production

### Token Operations

SPL tokens are the lifeblood of Solana DeFi. You'll build:

- Token balance fetching with proper caching
- Transfer flows with mobile-optimized UX
- Associated Token Account management
- Metadata display from various token standards

### NFT Operations

NFTs require special handling for media, metadata, and collections:

- Fetching NFT collections efficiently
- Displaying NFT media (images, video, 3D) on mobile
- Transfer and burn operations
- Working with Metaplex standards

### Blinks and Actions

Solana Actions and Blinks bring blockchain interactions to any surface:

- Understanding the Actions specification
- Building mobile-native Action clients
- Rendering Blinks in your app
- Security considerations for external Actions

### Program Interaction

Direct program interaction gives you full control:

- Building and signing arbitrary instructions
- Working with Anchor IDLs on mobile
- Transaction simulation for better UX
- Error handling and retry strategies

Before starting this course, you should have completed:

1. **Mobile Wallet Adapter** - Understanding MWA connection and authorization flows
2. **MWA Deep Dive** - Familiarity with transaction signing and session management

If you haven't completed those courses, we recommend starting there first.

Every lesson in this course considers mobile constraints:

**Network Reliability**: Mobile connections drop. Your app needs to handle partial completions, retries, and offline states gracefully.

**Battery Life**: Constant polling drains batteries. We'll use websockets, webhooks, and smart caching instead.

**Screen Real Estate**: Complex transaction details need thoughtful presentation on small screens.

**User Patience**: Mobile users expect instant feedback. We'll use optimistic updates and clear loading states.

<ArticleSection name="Development Setup" id="development-setup" level="h2" />

You'll need:

- React Native or Expo project with MWA configured
- Android device or emulator for testing
- Wallet app installed (Phantom or Solflare)
- Devnet SOL for testing transactions

If you completed the Mobile Wallet Adapter course, your environment is ready.

<ArticleSection name="Course Structure" id="course-structure" level="h2" />

Each lesson builds on the previous:

1. **RPC Fundamentals** - Connection setup, commitment levels, and mobile optimizations
2. **Token Operations** - SPL token transfers, balances, and metadata
3. **NFT Operations** - Collections, media handling, and NFT transfers
4. **Blinks and Actions** - Solana Actions specification and mobile implementation
5. **Program Interaction** - Building custom instructions and working with Anchor

By the end, you'll have the skills to build feature-rich mobile dApps that interact with any Solana program.

<ArticleSection name="Let's Begin" id="lets-begin" level="h2" />

Start with **RPC Fundamentals** to understand how your mobile app communicates with the Solana network. This foundation will support everything else you build.
