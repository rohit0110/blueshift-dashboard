# Anchor 101

![Anchor framework course - Learn Solana smart contract development with Anchor](/graphics/course-banners/anchor-for-dummies.png)

<ArticleSection name="What is Anchor" id="what-is-anchor" level="h2" />

Anchor is the premier framework for Solana smart-contract development, offering a complete workflow for writing, testing, deploying, and interacting with onchain programs.

### Key advantages

- **Reduced boilerplate**: Anchor abstracts the repetitive work of account management, instruction serialization, and error handling so you can focus on just the core business logic.
- **Built-in security**:  Rigorous checks such as account-ownership verification and data validation run out of the box, mitigating many common vulnerabilities before they surface.

### Anchor Macros

- `declare_id!()`: Declares at what onchain address the program lives.
- `#[program]`: Marks the module that contains every instruction entrypoint and business-logic function.
- `#[derive(Accounts)]`: Lists the accounts an instruction requires and enforces their constraints automatically.
- `#[error_code]`: Defines custom, human-readable error types that make debugging clearer and faster.

Together, these procedural macros abstract away low-level byte management, allowing you to deliver secure, production-grade Solana programs with far less effort.

### Program Structure

Let's begin with a bare-bones version of a program to explain in detail what each macro actually does:

```rust
declare_id!("22222222222222222222222222222222222222222222");

#[program]
pub mod blueshift_anchor_vault {
    use super::*;

    pub fn deposit(ctx: Context<VaultAction>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
        // ...
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn withdraw(ctx: Context<VaultAction>) -> Result<()> {
        // ...
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct VaultAction<'info> {
    // ...
}

#[error_code]
pub enum VaultError {
    // ...
}
```

This will transform into focused modules instead of cramming everything into the `lib.rs` for more structured programs. The program folder tree will look roughly like this:

```
src
├── instructions
│       ├── instruction1.rs
│       ├── mod.rs
│       ├── instruction2.rs
│       └── instruction3.rs
├── errors.rs
├── lib.rs
└── state.rs
```

#### `declare_id!()`

The `declare_id!()` macro assigns to your program its onchain address; a unique public key derived from the keypair in the project's `target` folder. That keypair signs and deploys the compiled `.so` binary containing all program logic and data.

**Note:** We use the placeholder `222222...` in Blueshift examples because of our internal test suite. In production, Anchor will generate a fresh program ID for you when you run the standard build and deploy commands.

#### `#[program]` & `#[derive(Accounts)]`

Every instruction has its own **Context** struct that lists all the accounts and, optionally, any data the instruction will need.  

In this example, both `deposit` and `withdraw` share the same accounts; for that reason, we're going to create a single account struct called `VaultAction` to keep things more efficient and easy.

#### A closer look at `#[derive(Accounts)]` macro

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct VaultAction<'info> {
  #[account(mut)]
  pub signer: Signer<'info>,

  #[account(
    mut,
    seeds = [b"vault", signer.key().as_ref()],
    bump,
  )]
  pub vault: SystemAccount<'info>,

  pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

As we can see from the code snippet, the `#[derive(Accounts)]` macro serves three critical responsibilities:
- Declares all the accounts a specific instruction needs.
- Enforce constraint checks automatically, blocking many bugs and potential exploits at runtime.
- Generates helper methods that let you access and mutate accounts safely.

It accomplishes this through a combination of account types and inline attributes.

**Account types in our example**
- `Signer<'info>`: Verifies the account signed the transaction; essential for security and for CPIs that demand a signature.
- `SystemAccount<'info>`: Confirms ownership of the account by the System Program.
- `Program<'info, System>`: Ensures the account is executable and matches the System Program ID, enabling CPIs such as account creation or lamport transfers.

**Inline attributes you'll encounter**
- `mut`: Flags the account as mutable; mandatory whenever its lamport balance or data may change.
- `seeds & bump`: Verifies the account is a Program-Derived Address (PDA) generated from the provided seeds plus a bump byte.

**Note** PDAs are important because:
- When used by the program that owns them, PDAs can sign CPIs on the program's behalf.
- They give you deterministic, verifiable addresses for persisting program state.

#### `#[error_code]`

The `#[error_code]` macro lets you define clear, custom errors inside the program.

```rust
#[error_code]
pub enum VaultError {
    #[msg("Vault already exists")]
    VaultAlreadyExists,
    #[msg("Invalid amount")]
    InvalidAmount,
}
```

Each enum variant can carry a `#[msg(...)]` attribute that logs a descriptive string whenever the error occurs; far more helpful than a raw numeric code during debugging.
