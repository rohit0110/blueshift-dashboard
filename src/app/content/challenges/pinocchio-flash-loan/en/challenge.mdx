# Pinocchio Flash Loan

![Pinocchio Flash Loan](/graphics/challenge-banners/pinocchio-flash-loan.png)

Instruction introspection is a powerful feature that allows a blockchain program to examine and analyze other instructions within the same transaction bundle. This includes instructions that have not yet been executed, giving your program the ability to "look ahead" and make decisions based on what will happen later in the transaction.

Think of it like having X-ray vision for transactions: your program can see through the entire transaction to understand the complete sequence of operations before deciding how to proceed.

The most compelling application of instruction introspection is flash loans. These are a unique type of loan that exists only within the boundaries of a single transaction.

Here's how flash loans work:
- **Borrow**: At the beginning of a transaction, you can instantly borrow a large amount of capital using a `loan` instruction
- **Use**: You can use this borrowed capital for trading, arbitrage, or other operations within the same transaction
- **Repay**: Before the transaction ends, you must repay the loan plus a small fee using a `repay` instruction

The key insight is that flash loans rely on the atomic nature of blockchain transactions. If any part of the transaction fails (including the repayment), the entire transaction is rolled back as if it never happened. This means the lender has zero risk: either they get repaid, or the loan never actually occurred.

In this challenge, you'll create a simple flash loan program that demonstrates instruction introspection in action. The program will examine instruction data and accounts across different instructions within the same transaction to ensure loan terms are met.

If you're new to instruction introspection, we recommend starting with the [Instruction Introspection Course](/en/courses/instruction-introspection) to understand the fundamental concepts used in this program.

<ArticleSection name="Installation" id="installation" level="h2" />

Before you begin, make sure Rust and Pinocchio are installed. Then, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
# create workspace
cargo new blueshift_pinocchio_flash_loan --lib --edition 2021
cd blueshift_pinocchio_flash_loan
```

Add `pinocchio`, `pinocchio-system`, and `pinocchio-token`:

```bash
cargo add pinocchio pinocchio-system pinocchio-token
```

Declare the crate types in `Cargo.toml` to generate deployment artifacts in `target/deploy`:

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["lib", "cdylib"]
```

You're now ready to write your flash loan program.

<ArticleSection name="Template" id="template" level="h2" />

This time, we'll split the program into small, focused modules instead of placing everything in `lib.rs`. The folder tree will look roughly like this:

```
src
├── instructions
│       ├── helpers.rs
│       ├── loan.rs
│       ├── mod.rs
│       └── repay.rs
├── lib.rs
```

**Note**: Remember to change the program ID to `22222222222222222222222222222222222222222222` since we use this under the hood to test your program.

The entrypoint in `lib.rs` is very similar to what we covered in the [Introduction to Pinocchio Course](/en/courses/introduction-to-pinocchio).

```rust
use pinocchio::{account_info::AccountInfo, entrypoint, program_error::ProgramError, pubkey::Pubkey, ProgramResult};
entrypoint!(process_instruction);

pub mod instructions;
pub use instructions::*;

// 22222222222222222222222222222222222222222222
pub const ID: Pubkey = [
    0x0f, 0x1e, 0x6b, 0x14, 0x21, 0xc0, 0x4a, 0x07, 
    0x04, 0x31, 0x26, 0x5c, 0x19, 0xc5, 0xbb, 0xee, 
    0x19, 0x92, 0xba, 0xe8, 0xaf, 0xd1, 0xcd, 0x07, 
    0x8e, 0xf8, 0xaf, 0x70, 0x47, 0xdc, 0x11, 0xf7, 
];

fn process_instruction(
    _program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
    match instruction_data.split_first() {
        Some((Loan::DISCRIMINATOR, data)) => Loan::try_from((data, accounts))?.process(),
        Some((Repay::DISCRIMINATOR, _)) => Repay::try_from(accounts)?.process(),
        _ => Err(ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData)
    }
}
```

<ArticleSection name="Helpers" id="helpers" level="h2" />

Before diving into the `loan` and `repay` instructions, let's examine `helpers.rs`:

```rust
#[repr(C, packed)]
pub struct LoanData {
    pub protocol_token_account: [u8; 32],
    pub balance: u64,
}

pub fn get_token_amount(data: &[u8], account: &AccountInfo) ->  Result<u64, ProgramError> {
    if !account.is_owned_by(&pinocchio_token::ID) {
        return Err(PinocchioError::InvalidOwner.into());
    }

    if account.data_len().ne(&pinocchio_token::state::TokenAccount::LEN) {
        return Err(PinocchioError::InvalidAccountData.into());
    }

    if data.len() != pinocchio_token::state::TokenAccount::LEN {
        return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData);
    }

    Ok(u64::from_le_bytes(data[64..72].try_into().unwrap()))
}
```

This file is straightforward. It contains a `LoanData` struct, which we'll use to temporarily store loan data in an account before the loan is repaid. It also provides a `get_token_amount()` helper function to read the token amount from an account.
