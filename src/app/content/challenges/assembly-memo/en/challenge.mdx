# Assembly Memo

In this unit we'll use sBPF Assembly to create a logging mechanism for our program.

The simplicity of a bite-size memo program is the perfect starting point for your sBPF assembly journey!

If you're unfamiliar with assembly programming, follow the [introduction to Assembly course](/en/courses/introduction-to-assembly)

Our program will simply put the right memory location into the right register and then perform the `sol_log_` syscall. It will look like this:

```sbpf
.equ NUM_ACCOUNTS, 0x00
.equ DATA_LEN, 0x08
.equ DATA, 0x10
.globl entrypoint
entrypoint:
  ldxdw r0, [r1+NUM_ACCOUNTS]
  ldxdw r2, [r1+DATA_LEN]
  add64 r1, DATA
  call sol_log_
  exit
```

<ArticleSection name="Memory Offsets" id="memory-offsets" level="h2" />

The program begins by declaring three `.equ` constants that define the memory layout of our instruction data:

```sbpf
.equ NUM_ACCOUNTS, 0x00  ; Offset for number of accounts
.equ DATA_LEN, 0x08      ; Offset for data length
.equ DATA, 0x10          ; Offset for actual data
```

These constants mark the byte-offsets relative to the entry-buffer pointer in `r1`:
- `NUM_ACCOUNTS` (0x0000): Points to the account count in the instruction data header for validation
- `DATA_LEN` (0x08): Points to the instruction data length in the instruction data header
- `DATA` (0x10): Points to the instruction data in the instruction data header

Unlike high-level languages that abstract memory layout, assembly requires knowing exactly where every piece of data lives.

<ArticleSection name="Entrypoint and Initial Validation" id="entrypoint-and-validations" level="h2" />

```sbpf
.globl entrypoint
entrypoint:
  ldxdw r0, [r1+NUM_ACCOUNTS]   ; Load number of accounts into r0
```

Every sBPF program starts at a global `.entrypoint` symbol. The Solana runtime provides account and instruction data through register `r1`.

This first instruction then loads the number of accounts into `r0`. Since `r0` is the register the VM reads on exit, this serves two purposes:
1. It loads the account count for our use
2. It ensures the program will fail automatically if any accounts are passed (non-zero value in r0)

<ArticleSection name="Sol Log Syscall" id="sol-log-syscall" level="h2" />

Next, we prepare the arguments for the `sol_log_` syscall:

```sbpf
ldxdw r2, [r1+DATA_LEN]   ; Load length of memo into r2
add64 r1, DATA            ; Adjust r1 to point to memo bytes
```

These instructions set up the arguments for `sol_log_`:
- `r2` receives the length of the memo data
- `r1` is adjusted to point directly to the memo bytes

And after that, we call `sol_log_` and exit:

```sbpf
call 16   ; Call sol_log_ (helper ID 16)
exit      ; Return using r0 value
```

<ArticleSection name="Conclusion" id="conclusion" level="h2" />

The program:
1. Calls 16 (`sol_log_`) to print the memo to the validator log
2. Exits using the value in `r0`
