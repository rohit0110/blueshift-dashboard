# Borrow

The borrow instruction is the first half of our flash loan system. It performs three critical steps to ensure safe and atomic lending:
1. Transfer funds: Move the requested `borrow_amount` from the protocol's treasury to the borrower's account
2. Verify repayment: Use instruction introspection to confirm that a valid repayment instruction exists at the end of the transaction

<ArticleSection name="Fund Transfer" id="fund-transfer" level="h2" />

First, we implement the actual transfer of funds with proper validation:

```rust
// Make sure we're not sending in an invalid amount that can crash our Protocol
require!(borrow_amount > 0, ProtocolError::InvalidAmount);

// Derive the Signer Seeds for the Protocol Account
let seeds = &[
    b"protocol".as_ref(),
    &[ctx.bumps.protocol]
];
let signer_seeds = &[&seeds[..]];

// Transfer the funds from the protocol to the borrower
transfer(
    CpiContext::new_with_signer(
        ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(), 
        Transfer {
            from: ctx.accounts.protocol_ata.to_account_info(),
            to: ctx.accounts.borrower_ata.to_account_info(),
            authority: ctx.accounts.protocol.to_account_info(),
        }, 
        signer_seeds
    ), 
    borrow_amount
)?;
```

This code ensures we're transferring a valid amount and uses the protocol's Program Derived Address (PDA) to authorize the transfer.

<ArticleSection name="Instruction Introspection" id="instruction-introspection" level="h2" />

Now comes the security-critical part: using instruction introspection to verify the transaction's structure and ensure our flash loan will be repaid.

We start by accessing the `instructions` sysvar, which contains information about all instructions in the current transaction:


```rust
/*
    Instruction Introspection

    This is the primary means by which we secure our program,
    enforce atomicity while making a great UX for our users.
*/

let ixs = ctx.accounts.instructions.to_account_info();
```

Finally, we perform the most critical check: ensuring that the last instruction in the transaction is a valid repayment instruction:
- We start by checking the position of the borrow instruction to make sure it's the only one
- Then we check the number of instruction and make sure that we're loading the last instruction of the transaction
- Then we verify that it's the repay instruction by verifying the program ID and the discriminator of the instruction
- We finish by verifying that the ATAs passed in the repay instruction are the same that we're passing in our `Borrow` instruction

```rust
/*
    Repay Instruction Check

    Make sure that the last instruction of this transaction is a repay instruction
*/

// Check if this is the first instruction in the transaction.
let current_index = load_current_index_checked(&ctx.accounts.instructions)?;
require_eq!(current_index, 0, ProtocolError::InvalidIx); 

// Check how many instruction we have in this transaction
let instruction_sysvar = ixs.try_borrow_data()?;
let len = u16::from_le_bytes(instruction_sysvar[0..2].try_into().unwrap());

// Ensure we have a repay ix
if let Ok(repay_ix) = load_instruction_at_checked(len as usize - 1, &ixs) {

    // Instruction checks
    require_keys_eq!(repay_ix.program_id, ID, ProtocolError::InvalidProgram);
    require!(repay_ix.data[0..8].eq(instruction::Repay::DISCRIMINATOR), ProtocolError::InvalidIx);

    // We could check the Wallet and Mint separately but by checking the ATA we do this automatically
    require_keys_eq!(repay_ix.accounts.get(3).ok_or(ProtocolError::InvalidBorrowerAta)?.pubkey, ctx.accounts.borrower_ata.key(), ProtocolError::InvalidBorrowerAta);
    require_keys_eq!(repay_ix.accounts.get(4).ok_or(ProtocolError::InvalidProtocolAta)?.pubkey, ctx.accounts.protocol_ata.key(), ProtocolError::InvalidProtocolAta);

} else {
    return Err(ProtocolError::MissingRepayIx.into());
}
```
