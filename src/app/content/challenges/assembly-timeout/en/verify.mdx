<ChallengeTitle>sBPF Assembly Timeout</ChallengeTitle>

Now that you are starting to feel comfortable writing Assembly, instead of using the `sol_get_clock_sysvar` try achieving the same goal by passing in the `Clock` account.

Create a program that only has one instruction. It must:
- Take in the `Clock` account (of size 40).
- Take in a u64 (8-byte) slot in instruction data.
- Use the first 8-bytes of the `Clock` account to grab the current slot.
- Check if the current slot is greater than the slot passed in the instruction. If it is, return error code 1.

> To get the right instruction data offset you can use our [tool](https://sbpf.xyz). Just remember to add one account and set its data length as 40! 

Start by installing the sBPF package like explained in the [tooling section](/en/courses/introduction-to-assembly/tooling) of the Introduction to Assembly course and build your program using the following command in your terminal:

```
sbpf build
```

This will generate a `.so` file in your `target/deploy` folder. 

Now click on the `take challenge` button and drop the file there!

<RequirementList>

    Your program should succeed when a slot higher than the current one is passed.
  </Requirement>

  <Requirement title="Challenge 2: Testing the Failure of a Timeout">
    Your program should fail when a slot lower than the current one is passed.
